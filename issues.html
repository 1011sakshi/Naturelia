                        Air Pollution
                    </h1>
                    <p>Air pollution is becoming an increasingly dangerous problem, particularly in heavily-populated cities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that 80% of people living in urban areas are exposed to air quality levels deemed unfit by the organization.</p>

                        Climate Change
                    </h1>
                    <p>The majority of the issues previously listed contribute or are linked to climate change. Statistics created by NASA state that global temperatures have risen by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, which is directly linked to a reduction in Arctic ice of 13.3% per decade.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>Continued human activities and expansion has led to lowered biodiversity. A lack of biodiversity means that future generations will have to deal with increasing vulnerability of plants to pests and fewer sources of fresh water.</p>

                        Acid Rain
                    </h1>
                    <p>Acid rain comes as a result of air pollution, mostly through chemicals released into the environment when fuel is burned. Its effects are most clearly seen in aquatic ecosystems, where increasing acidity in the water can lead to animal deaths.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>It is estimated that 63% of global fish stocks are now considered overfished. This has led to many fishing fleets heading to new waters, which will only serve to deplete fish stocks further.Overfishing leads to a misbalance of ocean life, severely affecting natural ecosystems in the process.</p>

                        Deforestation
                    </h1>
                    <p>The demands of an increasing population has resulted in increasing levels of deforestation. Current estimates state that the planet is losing 80,000 acres of tropical forests per day. This results in loss of habitat for many species, placing many at risk and leading to large-scale extinction.</p>

                    <p>Fresh water is crucial to life on Earth, yet more sources are being polluted through human activities each year. On a global scale, 2 million tons of sewage, agricultural and industrial waste enters the world’s water every day.</p>

Turn off unnecessary lights and use natural lighting, unplug unused electronics, run ACs and heaters mindfully, hang your clothes to dry, run full dishwashers and laundry loads, and consider switching to solar panels.</p>
